# Caltech 10 CPU

This is an implementation of the Caltec 10 CPU using Advanced Boolean Expression Language (ABEL). It is meant to be complied with Lattice Semiconductor ispLEVER Classic. The code contains the following submodules

- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Control Unit (CU)
- Data Memory Address Unit (DAU)
- Program Address Unit (PAU)
- high level module CPU

This implementation completed all necessary requirements for the 2024 Caltech 10 CPU project. In addition, it also completed the following extra credits

- Arithmetic Negation Instruction (25 points)
- Shift and Rotate Instructions (40 points)
- Input/Output Instructions (20 points)
- Index Register Instructions (30 points)
- Fitting design onto 4256V CPLD (40 points)
